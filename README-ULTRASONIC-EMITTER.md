> A modification of the Watchy menu system to add ultrasonic emitter control functionality

## What is the project?

The Ultrasonic Emitter Watchy is a modification of the Watchy menu system that facilitates simple commands to the Ultrasonic Emitter Node via the Ultrasonic Emitter Server.

For the Watchy README file as of 5/26/2024 see README-WATCHY.md

## What is the MVP?

The minimal valuable product is software that provides on and off commands.

## What are the nice to haves?

The nice to haves for this project are mechanisms to obtain the current state, turn the emitter on for a limited period of time, and reboot the server and node remotely.

## When will the project be complete?

The project will be complete once the app is successfully issuing commands to the Server.

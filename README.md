> My personal collection of enhancements to the Watchy features and various watch faces

## What is the project?

This is really a collection of enhancements more than a project per say. It is also a fork of my Ultrasonic Emitter Watchy repo since I need that feature too.

For the Ultrasonic Emitter README file as of 6/14/2024 see README-ULTRASONIC-EMITTER.md
For the Watchy README file as of 5/26/2024 see README-WATCHY.md

* Re-arrangement of watch face.
* Elimination of unnecessary items like year, word day of week, and steps.
* Addition of time functionality.
